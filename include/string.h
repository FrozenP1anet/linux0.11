 * This string-include defines all string functions as inline

 * normal. Most of the string-functions are rather heavily hand-optimized,
 * see especially strtok,strstr,str[c]spn. They should work, but are not
 * very easy to understand. Everything is done entirely within the register
 * set, making the functions fast and clean. String instructions have been
 * used through-out, making for "slightly" unclear code :-)
